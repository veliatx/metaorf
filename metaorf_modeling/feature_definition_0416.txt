# coverage
sum:	the total number of reads (more specifically, psites of reads) mapped to each ORF (-log10)
mean:	sum divided by the length of each ORF (-log10)
std:	the standard deviation of psite counts across locations within each ORF (i.e. the degree of psites distribution)
n_reads_orf_vs_genome:	the ratio of reads falling inside the ORF region vs the total number of reads falling in the genomic region between the start and end of the ORF
pos_1_vs_0:
pos_2_vs_0:	the ratio of #psites falling on the second/third position of an ORF vs the first position
frames_1_vs_0:
frames_2_vs_0:	the ratio of #psites falling in the frame 1/2 vs frame 0 (i.e. the start codon frame)
periodicity_first_60_1_vs_0
periodicity_first_60_2_vs_0:	same as above, except for the 60bp region after the start codon
periodicity_last_60_1_vs_0
periodicity_last_60_2_vs_0:	same as above, except for the 60bp region before the stop codon
n_empty_codons:		codons w/o any psite coverage (-log10)
longest_empty_length_whole:	the longest subsequence inside the orf w/o any coverage (-log10)
longest_empty_length_first_30:	same as above, except for the first 30bp region after the start codon (-log10)
longest_empty_length_last_30:	same as above, except for the 30bp region before the stop codon (-log10)



# signal drop
## Here we use the psite coverages within different regions for calculation. In each group, we have two values to report, mean and max. The calculation of the "mean" values uses the average coverage values within the specified regions while the calculation of the "max" values only uses the coverage at a single location within each region where the coverage is the highest. The signal drops are presented as -log10(drop_value) and capped at -3 and 3.

five_utr_vs_cds_mean: 
five_utr_vs_cds_max: five_utr -> 60 bp before the start codon, cds -> 60 bp at and after the start codon

five_utr_vs_start_codon_mean
five_utr_vs_start_codon_max: start_codon -> 9 bp region with the start codon as the center

cds_utr_vs_start_codon_mean
cds_utr_vs_start_codon_max: same as above

three_utr_vs_cds_mean
three_utr_vs_cds_max: three_utr -> 60 bp after the stop codon, cds -> 60 bp at and before the stop codon

three_utr_vs_stop_codon_mean
three_utr_vs_stop_codon_max: stop_codon -> 3 bp before the stop codon

cds_utr_vs_stop_codon_mean 
cds_utr_vs_stop_codon_max: same as above


# 3' and 5' UTR
dist_neg_100
dist_neg_150 
dist_pos_100
dist_pos_150: distance of the nearest peak that is 100% (or 150%) in the upstream (neg) and downstream (pos) of the start codon (-log10)

five_utr_periodicity: the ratio of coverage of psites for frame 1 and 2 against frame 0 for the 30bp 5'UTR region before the start codon
five_utr_in_frame_bins: the number of 3-bp bins with the first position with the highest coverage
three_utr_periodicity: 
three_utr_in_frame_bins: same as above, except for the 30bp 3'UTR region after the stop codon
